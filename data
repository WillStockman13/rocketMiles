She is house trained and very friendly. Buttercup loves going for rides in the car and hanging out with her people. She's super affectionate and has lived with humans of all ages, even a baby. Buttercup responds well to invisible fences and is a wonderful walker. She never messes in the house and has lived with cats.

He is an old guy who deserved to be loved.  His owner moved and left him and a little Maltese behind.

Rusty tends to talk with his mouth by grabbing your arm and also initiates play by being very mouthy. He seems handshy with some men. \n\nHe is not reactive to dogs or cats and attends doggie daycare. Rusty is from a rural area and from his behavior we think he probably lived on a chain for a while. He does know sit and high five, is food motivated and was doing okay on house training in his previous foster home. He walks reasonably well on a leash if he has had the proper amount of daily exercise.\n\nA female foster may work best while he is learning some manners and the ropes of being an indoor pet. A behavior consultant/trainer will be available for help. \n\nIf you're interested in fostering Rusty, please let us know.If you have any questions or would like to meet this pet, please email contact@stlpetrescue.com. Information about the rescue and adoption process can also be found at stlpetrescue.com along with a full listing of our adoptable pets. \n\nOur adoption fees are as follows:\n\n$135 kittens 2 - 6 months\n$120 kittens 7-11 months\n$100 cats 1 and over\n$75 special needs\n$150 special breeds\n$250 puppies 2-6 months\n$200 7 months on up\n$250 small breeds\n\nThis fee includes: felv/fiv/heartworm testing, worming, flea and ear mite treatments, age appropriate vaccinations, spay/neuter, rabies vaccination, and microchip with free registration.\n\nThe adoption process includes an interview, application, adoption contract, which includes a return obligation if adopter is needing to rehome pet.

She was pulled from the at risk  list by Anjellicle Cats on 2/7/13.  She had contracted a URI from the shelter and she was understandably very depressed.  She was so despondent that she refused to eat for another week after being saved.  In those first days of freedom from her cage, she would just sit in her bed, barely moving.  You could see defeat in her eyes.\n \nShe has slowly come out of her shell, but she still has some trust issues.  She is affectionate in spurts and has learned how to play again!  She loves chasing that red dot and likes to play fetch with toy mice and balls.  She sometimes even catches on the fly, just like Derek Jeter!  She seems to like other cats and has tried to befriend her foster mom's cat, but Emerald is a bit snobby, so it's coming along slowly.\n \nOreo would fill that empty spot in your heart.    There's no doubt she would offer a lifetime of gratitude and love to the lucky family who adopts her.\n\nShe was born around 2/7/11."}{"name":"Sapa-Foster Home Needed","pic":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36085569/1/?bust=1474650701&width=500&-x.jpg","description":"Please note donations using the SPONSOR ME tab will not go to Fluffy Dog Rescue.\n\nTo Locate Our Application go to www.fluffydog.net.www.http://rescue.fluffydog.net/How_to_adopt.html\n\nOur listings are updated throughout the day.

WHERE I AM FROM: TN (arrival 9/22) \n\nMY STORY: We recently added two unique dogs to our rescue. Their names are Wanagi and Sapa. They are sisters that are looking to find a new home after their owner passed away. \n\nThese short legged big gals are a tail wagging happy pair. They do walk very nice on leash and seem well socialized. Very people friendly and soak up any attention we have given them. No they are not darling little pups with sweet puppy breath. What they are can be much better and easier. Your shoes and prized belongings won't be chewed up, no need to potty train, after an exhausting day of work all that is needed is a moderate length walk then snuggles on the couch as you watch TV. They are good sized girls so a good sized couch will be needed. \n\nThis is really what rescue is all about, giving dogs a chance they deserve.\nThis dog does need a foster home. Have you ever considered fostering a dog?  For more information, see the Fluffy dog rescue home page. This dog does shed and is not hypoallergenic.\n\nHOUSEBROKEN? Yes  GOOD WITH DOGS?  Yes  GOOD WITH CATS? No\n\nADOPTION FEE: $200 no training fee. \n\nTo adopt the FIRST STEP is to complete an APPLICATION.
