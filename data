{"name":"Ellie Mae","pic":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/29379579/1/?bust=1471792777&width=500&-x.jpg","description":"This is Ellie Mae. She's a very sweet Blue Heeler mix. She enjoys pushing up onto your lap to maximize the amount of chin and head scratches she receives. She's pretty good with basic commands, walks well on a leash (unless she's REALLY interested in something you're not walking towards!) and goes on daily runs with foster dad each morning. She gets along great with other dogs in her foster home, even when one of the other fosters gets a bit rowdy and wants to play constantly. Ellie Mae just takes it all in stride. That said, smaller dogs are not the best fit for Ellie Mae. Ellie Mae is crate trained, but she's definitely not a fan of it. If you're looking for a loving dog who enjoys cuddles & kisses, definitely check out this beautiful girl!\n\nAll SAAP dogs and puppies are vet checked, UTD on vaccines, spayed/neutered, micro chipped, and given flea and heartworm preventative as age appropriate. \n\nOur website is: http://www.adoptastray.com/\n\nTo check if this animal is still available visit our master pet list on our website at: \nhttp://www.adoptastray.com/adoptable-animals/\n\nHave questions: \nPlease email us at saap@adoptastray.com for more information about this animal or to answer any questions you may have.

He is housetrained reliably (though expect accidents at first), crates well for the workday, and minds his house manners well. He has a great watchdog bark for when people come over and then is all wags and happiness to see them. Harrison is excellent with other dogs but needs a cat and small animal free home as they are too tempting to chase. He is good with older kids (12+) who can take an active role in training and exercising him but is being surrendered due to not enjoying the company of the younger ones. Harrison is an active boy and loves to go for walks/runs and play in the yard (fenced). He knows heel, sit, down, and has good recall unless he sees something fun to chase so he still needs work to be reliable off leash. Harrison is going to make someone so lucky to call him theirs!\n\nRequirements: No cats. Kids ages 12+\n\nYou can email laurahhk9@gmail.com with questions and for a preadopt application. This dog has been spayed/neutered, vaccinated as age appropriate, tested for heartworm disease if age appropriate, and dewormed."}{"name":"Caroline","pic":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/36380307/1/?bust=1475436503&width=500&-x.jpg","description":"Hi, my name is Caroline & I am a Shepherd mix, around 20 lbs full grown.
